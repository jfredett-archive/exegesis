* 0.0.5
	* Split up the project into three projects
		- Exegesis remains as the FileSystem API
		- Katuv is a new tool for defining and dealing with internal DSLs
		- Eisegesis is the build tool proper, which uses Katuv and Exegesis to
		provide build related functionality.
	* Prepare for splitting out Drosophila, which contains the flyweight
	implementation (mostly so I never have to write another Flyweight again)
	* Update some docs to reflect the changes

* 0.0.3 - 0.0.4
	* Make sure Forwardable gem dependency gets loaded at the appropriate
		load-level
	* Skirt a very rare crash during tests (happens _literally_ only to my one
		computer) in rubinius 2.0.0rc1
	* Internal Refactoring to avoid stubbing core classes like `File` and `Dir`

* 0.0.2
	Large amount of functionality in place, including BaseDirectories,
	Directories, SourceFiles, and Visitors. Internal Architectural stuff also
	working (objects are stored in flyweights so there are no duplicates and
	everything stays synced.

* 0.0.1
	Initial Release
